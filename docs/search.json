There is no reason why you should bother to learn about it, but if you are curious, it was some sort of thing I used to leave in my R code as an Easter Egg, in case someone read my code sometime later. Might even use it again in the near future. This package contains “a collection of fortunes from the R community”. In particular, this was, and probably still is, my favourite one\n\nlibrary(fortunes)\n\nfortune(108)\n\n\nActually, I see it as part of my job to inflict R on people who are perfectly\nhappy to have never heard of it. Happiness doesn't equal proficient and\nefficient. In some cases the proficiency of a person serves a greater good than\ntheir momentary happiness.\n   -- Patrick Burns\n      R-help (April 2005)"
